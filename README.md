## Intended order of lessons
1. Firewall Intro
2. Firewall as DHCP Server
3. Complex Firewalls and DMZs
## Evidence/Summary
This research project focuses on the development of a comprehensive guide or "cookbook" for configuring ASA Firewalls using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project comprises three lessons, each offering a step-by-step tutorial accompanied by packet tracer files and challenge activities. The first two lessons cover basic firewall software configuration and utilizing firewall hardware as a DHCP server. The final lesson presents a more advanced challenge, simulating a scenario where students must secure a network from potential threats using a DMZ configuration.
- The sources I used for researching this activity can be found below in the bibliography
- Evidence for the development of these tutorials can be found in the history of this repository and also my original repository for this project, which was my first draft. This first draft was abandoned for the sake of a final project that was easy to navigate and not ugly to look at. [Here is a link to that repository](https://github.com/mooroon/cookbooks)
- Here is some evidence of the creation process of the packet tracer files:

The development process involved extensive research into ASA Firewalls and GitHub, including learning how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration. The project utilized various design artifacts, such as step-by-step tutorials, packet tracer files, and challenge activities, to ensure clarity and effectiveness. 


The project ventured beyond my existing knowledge by not only exploring ASA Firewalls, of which i knew very little but also incorporating GitHub for project management and version control, and the activity manager on Packet Tracer. I had never used either of these tools before and had to do some independent research to figure how to utilise them.


The project's complexity is hopefully evident in its approach to teaching ASA Firewalls, GitHub usage, and network security concepts. The incorporation of theoretical concepts such as firewalls, DMZ, AAA configuration, SSH configuration, and RSA key pairs demonstarte a level of complexity. Furthermore, there was also the inclusion of challenge activities and the creation of custom packet tracer files.
